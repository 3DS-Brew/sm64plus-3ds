# v2.2.0 (??/01/2022):

### Changes:
- The custom camera mode got completely overhauled, and should now be much more usable.
- Made it so that collecting a star when "Stay in Course After Getting a Star" setting is enabled fills your health.
- The default presets were slightly altered.

### Fixes:
- Fixed a bug that would cause the level progression to break when "Tie Bowser's Sub to Missions" and "Stay in Course After Getting a Star" settings are both enabled.
