# Frequently Asked Questions

## **Q:** I can't build. I'm getting an error!

**A:** It seems like reinstalling MSYS2 and deleting the SM64Plus folder fixes the issues for most people. Disabling your antivirus could also help in some cases.

One other alternative you have is to use [sm64pcBuilder2](https://sm64pc.info/sm64pcbuilder2/) instead to build the game. Or you can also just compile the game manually, following the instructions from below.

If these don't help, you can ask for help on our Discord server. **Don't ask for help without following these steps first, and don't ask me help about sm64pcBuilder2 or building manually.**

## **Q:** I could build, but the game doesn't launch.

**A:** You can try rebuilding the game from the main menu. When asked to clear your build files, say yes.

<br>

## **Q:** The game is running too fast!

**A:** You can try to limit the game's FPS using Nvidia's control panel or other 3rd party tools. Make sure that you limit the "sm64.us.f3dex2e.exe"'s frame rate, and not the launcher's.

## **Q:** My controller doesn't work in the game. What do I do?

**A:** The game itself doesn't have support for DirectInput controllers yet. You can add it to your Steam library, which seems to make most controllers work. You can also use a tool like DS4Windows, BetterJoyForCemu, or 360ce depending on your controller.

## **Q:** I just updated the game and everything is black!

**A:** Hold "left", "right ", and "backspace" keys down for 4 seconds in the title screen and go through the setup once again.

<br>

## **Q:** Can I have a logo of the game?

**A:** [Sure.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828684639618203688/828756298643931176/sm64plus-centred.png) Shoutouts to [Benial](https://twitter.com/Benial17) for doing such a good job with it.

## **Q:** Can I use mods with this? 

**A:** Starting with version 1.1.0 there are 2 types of mods you can use.

**1) Texture Packs**

You can install custom texture packs by copying the texture files to the "C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\SM64Plus\gfx" folder. If you're asked to replace files, say yes. The folder layout and file names for the textures should be the same as what most other PC port forks. Make sure that the texture pack you're using has segmented skybox textures, otherwise you won't be able to see any differences with the skybox.

This feature is considered experimental and may have issues.

**1) Custom Models**

You can install custom model mods easily using [sm64pcBuilder2](https://sm64pc.info/sm64pcbuilder2/).

<br>

## **Q:** What about Render96?

**A:** The official Render96 texture pack works with SM64Plus, but lacks the segmented skybox textures. The models do not to work directly at the moment, but if you're willing to take on the challenge, it should be possible to fix the errors and make them work.

<br>

## **Q:** Is there Linux or Mac support?

**A:** Linux support is in works but needs further testing. There's no Mac support planned.

<br>

## **Q:** Is your game safe?

**A:** Yeah. If your antivirus is giving you any warnings, it's most likely false. You especially shouldn't trust Chrome on this kind of stuff.

<br>

## **Q:** Will Nintendo take this game down?
