# Frequently Asked Questions

## **Q:** I can't build. I'm getting an error!

**A:** It seems like reinstalling [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and deleting the "sm64plus" folder fixes the issues for most people. Disabling your antivirus could also help in some cases.

One other alternative you have is to use [sm64pcBuilder2](https://sm64pc.info/sm64pcbuilder2/) instead to build the game. Or you can also just compile the game manually, following the instructions from the [README file](https://github.com/MorsGames/sm64plus/blob/master/README.md).

If these don't help, you can ask for help on our Discord server. **Don't ask for help without following these steps first, and don't ask me help about sm64pcBuilder2 or building manually.**

## **Q:** I could build, but the game doesn't launch.

**A:** You can try rebuilding the game from the main menu. When asked to clear your build files, say yes.

<br>

## **Q:** The game is running too fast!

**A:** You can try to limit the game's FPS using Nvidia's control panel or other 3rd party tools. Make sure that you limit the "sm64.us.f3dex2e.exe"'s frame rate, and not the launcher's.

## **Q:** My controller doesn't work in the game. What do I do?

**A:** The game itself only has support for XInput controllers. You can add it to your Steam library, which seems to make most controllers work. You can also use a tool like DS4Windows, BetterJoyForCemu, or 360ce depending on your controller.

<br>

## **Q:** Some of the textures appear black and purple, how do I fix this?

**A:** Delete the "C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\SM64Plus\gfx" folder. If that doesn't work, hold "left", "right", and "backspace" keys down for 4 seconds in the title screen and go through the setup once again.

<br>

## **Q:** How do I access the hidden settings?

**A:** Press backspace or select on the press any key screen.

<br>

## **Q:** Can I have the logo of the game?

**A:** [Sure.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828684639618203688/828756298643931176/sm64plus-centred.png) Shoutouts to [Benial](https://twitter.com/Benial17) for doing such a good job with it.

<br>

## **Q:** Can I use mods with this? 

**A:** You can install custom texture packs by copying the texture files to the "C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\SM64Plus\gfx" folder. If you're asked to replace files, say yes.

The folder layout and file names for the textures is same as what most other PC port forks use. Also, if the texture pack you're using doesn't have segmented skybox textures, you won't be able to see any differences with how the skybox looks.

As for custom models, can install those easily using [sm64pcBuilder2](https://sm64pc.info/sm64pcbuilder2/).

<br>

## **Q:** What about Render96?

**A:** The official Render96 texture pack works with SM64Plus, with the exception of skybox textures. The models do not to work with SM64Plus at this moment though. If you're willing to take on the challenge, it should be possible to fix the errors and make them work, but don't expect that to be a trivial task.

<br>

## **Q:** Is there Linux or Mac support?

**A:** Linux support is in works, but needs further testing. There's no Mac support planned.

<br>

## **Q:** Is your game safe?

**A:** Yeah. If your antivirus is giving you any warnings, it's most likely false. You especially shouldn't trust Chrome on this kind of stuff.

<br>

## **Q:** Will Nintendo take this game down?
